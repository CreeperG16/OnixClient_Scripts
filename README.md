```

<h3>STEP 2</h3>

Make 'Scripts' folder


<h3>STEP 3</h3>

Click onto the module or cmd you want from this repo.


<h3>STEP 4</h3>

then click the ``raw`` button then do ctrl + s then save in the modules/scripts folder, make sure the file extention is .lua and **not** .txt


<h3>STEP 5</h3>

Open 'Modules' folder and delete modules that you do not want to use

<h2>Remember to put the following in chat after adding/editing scripts :</h2> 

```diff
.lua reload
```
