### STEP 1
Press 'Win + R' and type in

```
explorer.exe %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\OnixClient
```

### STEP 2

Make 'Scripts' folder and send in chat ``.lua reload`` to create sub folders.


### STEP 3

Click onto the module or cmd you want from this repo.


### STEP 4

then click the ``raw`` button then do ctrl + s then save in the modules/scripts folder, make sure the file extention is .lua and **not** .txt as it is .txt by default so you're gonna need to change it for the scripts to work.


## Remember to put the following in chat after adding/editing scripts : 

```
.lua reload
```
This is because when saving/editing scripts the game won't notice that you've made modifications unless you do the cmd in chat.
You can do .lua autoreload to make it automatically reload when you've edited a script.
