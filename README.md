## How to install scripts

### Setup script

Use this setup script to get started quickly and easily.
Press `Win + R` and paste this in:

```
powershell.exe -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnixClient-Scripts/OnixClient_Scripts/master/Extras/SetupScript.ps1')"
```

This will set up the whole environment:

### STEP 1

Press 'Win + R' and type in

```
explorer.exe %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\OnixClient
```

### STEP 2

Make 'Scripts' folder and send in chat `.lua reload` to create sub folders.

### STEP 3

Click onto the module or cmd you want from this repo.

### STEP 4

then click the `raw` button then do ctrl + s then save in the modules/scripts folder, make sure the file extention is .lua and **not** .txt as it is .txt by default so you're gonna need to change it for the scripts to work.

## Remember to put the following in chat after adding/editing scripts :

```
.lua reload
```

This is because when saving/editing scripts the game won't notice that you've made modifications unless you do the cmd in chat.
You can do .lua autoreload to make it automatically reload when you've edited a script.
