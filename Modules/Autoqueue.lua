Made by jqms w/ help from onix cuz he gamer

if you want to use .rq, you need the script, its called "HiveRequeue.lua" on the github.
alternatively you can just make a new command and put this as the code:

    command = "rq"
    help_message = "Requeues Hive Games"
    function execute(arguments)
    sendLocalData("00409ed7-72f4-4575-8028-c0abf7736a49", "e")
    end
